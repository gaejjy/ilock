    * println()     Prints data to the Serial ports as human-readable ASCII text  followed by a carriage return character (ASCII 13, or '\r')  and new line character (ASCII 10 or '\n').  

    * Speed gap     The wireless programming can be done in bi-way between  the CENTRAL and PERIPHERAL BLE devices, but the speed  is different, i.e.
                    
                    CENTRAL -> PERIPHERAL 2KB/s
                    PERIPHERAL -> CENTRAL 4KB/s
                    
                    I am not sure but, is the reason why I(Central) got the massage
                    from your(Peripheral) vertically?
                    and your(Peripheral) got the massage horizontally?

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    1. What is that between the microcontroller(ATmega328P) and Bluetooth chip(CC2540);
    how to communicate between them

    2. How to code AT commands on the sketch in Arduino IDE?

This is a program for opening the door or closing.
by using bluetooth and wifi network.

it's gonna be separated into two things.
One is using raspberry pi.
the other one is using bluno beetle.
some files which are gonna be used by beetle have 
the things like .ino arduino files.
